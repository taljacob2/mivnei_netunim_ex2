Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_entry}{Entry$<$ K, V $>$}} \\*This class represents a general {\itshape entry}, which is composed from a {\itshape key} and a {\itshape value} }{\pageref{class_entry}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_input_output}{Input\+Output}} \\*This class bundles together all the input / output methods of the program }{\pageref{class_input_output}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_min_heap}{Min\+Heap$<$ K, V $>$}} \\*This class implements a {\bfseries{Minimum-\/\+Heap}} which its elements are pointers to {\bfseries{lvalue {\ttfamily Entries}}} that are composed of a {\itshape key} and a {\itshape value} }{\pageref{class_min_heap}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_min_heap_a_d_t}{Min\+Heap\+ADT$<$ K, V $>$}} \\*This class represents an {\itshape abstract} {\bfseries{Minimum-\/\+Heap}}, which its elements are {\itshape Entries} that are composed by a {\itshape key} and a {\itshape value} }{\pageref{class_min_heap_a_d_t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classmy__algorithms}{my\+\_\+algorithms}} \\*This class bundles together all the algorithm methods in the program }{\pageref{classmy__algorithms}}{}
